# # Exercise 6: Weather data calculation
# 
# ### Part 1 
# 
# You should start by reading the data file.
# 
# - Read the data file into variable the variable `data`
#     - Skip the second row
#     - Convert the no-data values (`-9999`) into `NaN`

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = None

# YOUR CODE HERE 1
# Define relative path to the file
fp = "data/1091402.txt"
# Read data using varying amount of spaces as separator and  specifying -9999 as NoData values, skipping the second line.
data = pd.read_csv(fp,delim_whitespace = True,skiprows = [1] ,na_values = ['-9999'])
#Check that the dataframe 
print(data.head())
#Check the last rows of the data
print(data.tail())

# ### Part 2 
# 
# In this section, you will calculate simple statistics based on the input data:
# 
# - Calculate how many no-data (NaN) values there are in the `TAVG` column
#     - Assign your answer to a variable called `tavg_nodata_count`.

tavg_nodata_count = None
#YOUR CODE HERE 2
# Calculate how many no-data values there are in the TANG column
tavg_nodata_count = data['TAVG'].isnull().sum()

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# Print out the solution:
print('Number of no-data values in column "TAVG":',tavg_nodata_count)
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END


# - Calculate how many no-data (NaN) values there are for the `TMIN` column
#     - Assign your answer into a variable called `tmin_nodata_count`

tmin_nodata_count = None
#YOUR CODE HERE 3
# Calculate how many no-data values there are in the TMIN column
tmin_nodata_count = data['TMIN'].isnull().sum()

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# Print out the solution:
print('Number of no-data values in column "TMIN":', tmin_nodata_count)
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END


# - Calculate the total number of days covered by this data file
#     - Assign your answer into a variable called day_count

day_count = None 
#YOUR CODE HERE 4
# Calculate the total number of days
day_count = len(data['DATE'])

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# Print out the solution:
print("Number of days:", day_count)
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END

# - Find the date of the oldest (first) observation
#     - Assign your answer into a variable called `first_obs`


first_obs = None
 
# YOUR CODE HERE 5
#Find the date of the oldest observation 
first_obs = min(data['DATE'])

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# Print out the solution:
print('Date of the first observation:',first_obs)
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END

# - Find the date of the most recent (last) observation
#     - Assign your answer into a variable called `last_obs`

last_obs = None

# YOUR CODE HERE 6
#Find the data of most recent observation
last_obs = max(data['DATE'])

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# Print out the solution:
print('Date of the last observation:', last_obs)
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END


# - Find the average temperature for the whole data file (all observtions) from column `TAVG`
#     - Assign your answer into a variable called `avg_temp`

avg_temp = None

# YOUR CODE HERE 7
#Find the average temperature for the whole data file from column TAVG
avg_temp = data['TAVG'].mean()

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# Print out the solution:
print('Average temperature (F) for the whole dataset:', round(avg_temp, 2))
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END


# - Find the average `TMAX` temperature over the Summer of 1969 (months May, June, July, and August of the year 1969)
#     - Assign your answer into a variable called `avg_temp_1969`

avg_temp_1969 = None

# YOUR CODE HERE 8
#Specify a range and caluclate the average
data2 = data.query('19690501<=DATE<=19690831')
avg_temp_1969 = data2['TMAX'].mean()

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# This test print should print a number
print('Average temperature (F) for the Summer of 69:', round(avg_temp_1969, 2))
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END


# ## Problem 2 - Calculating monthly average temperatures (*3 points*)
# 

monthly_data = None

# YOUR CODE HERE 9
# I couldn't do this problem. Because this problem was very difficult for me.

#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART START
# This test print should print the length of variable monthly_data
print(len(monthly_data))

# This test print should print the column names of monthly_data
print(monthly_data.columns.values)

# This test print should print the mean of temp_celsius
print(round(monthly_data['temp_celsius'].mean(),2))

# This test print should print the median of temp_celsius
print(round(monthly_data['temp_celsius'].median(), 2))
#CAUTION!!! DON'T EDIT THIS PART END
